# Decentralized Affordable Housing Allocation

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, equitable, and efficient management of affordable housing resources.

## Overview

This decentralized application leverages blockchain technology to transform affordable housing allocation by creating a transparent, tamper-proof system that increases trust, reduces fraud, and ensures fair access to housing opportunities. By digitizing the entire process from property registration to ongoing compliance monitoring, the system helps address the critical shortage of affordable housing while promoting social equity.
